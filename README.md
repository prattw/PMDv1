### First Javascript, CSS, HTML, JQuery, API call project

### EXSUM:
#### For this project, I executed 4 code pushes.  The first push was primarily a rough attempt at mostly CSS and HTML styling and functionality with an attempt at calling the API in Javascript.  The second push was after correctly calling the API and some improvement to the CSS.  In the third push, I solved the HTML and CSS issue of the background picture with some feature additions.  The fourth and final push was completing the README.md file.

### Outstanding issues:
#### The <div> section text do not adjust/resize with size of the window or in mobile (see image scr:(".../img/in_mobile"))

- Recommended COA: Continue to review course documents and video.

#### The Revenue TTM didn't render with a $, just a string.

- Recommended COA: RFI for instructors because it must be incredily simple.

### Credits:
#### I would not have finished this project had it not been for the and patience of Yanny and videos by Alex Merced, class recording of Ira and other assorted videos from Traversy.
